The aim of this study is to employ Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) analysis to examine the relative importance of smartphone attributes that influence consumer preferences for smartphones offered by Chinese companies. In recent years, Chinese manufacturers have emerged as significant players in the global smartphone market, offering competitive features at various price points.

Using the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model, we obtained consistent estimates of part-worth coefficients that apply uniformly across all respondents.  
However, the Mixed MNL model allows for individual variation by assigning distinct coefficients to each respondent. In the Mixed model, these individual-specific coefficients are treated as random variables drawn from predefined probability distributions, and are therefore referred to as random effects.

The sensitivity analysis results, shown below, indicate that across both scenarios, the most important feature for consumers is having a high amount of RAM (measured in GBs).  
This is followed by the preference for non-foldable devices and medium-quality cameras.

Furthermore, brand preference does not significantly incentivize customers to choose a particular product.  
Even Huawei — the highest-rated among the analyzed brands — only achieves a neutral perception.
